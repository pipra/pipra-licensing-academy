# Pipra Licensing Academy Website

## Overview

This is the code that runs the website for the Pipra Licensing Academy.
It will be run on [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/).
To work on it, you'll need to download the App Engine SDK.  (App Engine essentially
provides free hosting and makes it easier for us to maintain this app.)
